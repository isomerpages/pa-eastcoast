<h1>Essentials at half-price</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Our community grocery shopping initiative aims to support East Coast GRC
residents with lower incomes by offering significant savings on daily essentials.
Eligible participants can purchase up to $200 worth of groceries at a 50%
discount, effectively reducing their cost of living.</p>
<p>With around 400 essential items available, including rice, eggs, cooking
oil, coffee, and body wash, residents can access a wide range of necessary
products. The success of this programme was evident in the first session,
where eligible residents benefited from at least $40,000 in total discounts,
demonstrating the initiative's positive impact on the community.</p>
<p>No one is left behind on the East Coast.</p>
