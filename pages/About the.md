<h2><strong>CARING, VIBRANT &amp; GREEN</strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>We are made up 5 unique divisions with one common goal; to make the <strong>EAST SIDE</strong> the <strong>BEST SIDE</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Together with our Grassroots Leaders and Community Volunteers, East Coast
brings initiatives, programmes and events to our residents, keeping the
'kampung' spirit alive, building and bridging communities in achieving
one people, one East Coast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We dream to build an East Coast where neighbours care for each other,
in their most vibrant neighbourhoods surrounded by the most luscious green
space in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We ask you to join us in our journey in building the most exciting place
in Singapore.</p>
