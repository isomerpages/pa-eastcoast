<h4>WHAT IS THE EAST COAST PLAN?</h4>
<p>Under the East Coast Plan, we create a <strong>VIBRANT, CARING</strong> and <strong>GREEN</strong> community
where residents feel that they belong. More importantl, they are empowered
to make a difference for their fellow Easties.</p>
<p>Easties come from a diverse background with varying interests and needs.
We <strong>care</strong> for each and every one of our residents. East Coast
has the highest number of active seniors aged 50 years and above in Singapore,
and we want our seniors to feel safe and cared for. We also support underprivileged
households and individuals with social assistance schemes to help them
deal with day-to-day challenges.</p>
<p>Easties are proud of our <strong>vibrant</strong> community. Our food, heritage,
recreational and sporting facilities attract many to the East. Community
centres, neighbourhood exercise corners, park connectors and new sports
halls encourage our residents of all ages to pursue a healthy and active
lifestyle. We continue to bring greater vibrancy to our community; uplifting
and nurturing our young through lifelong learning programmes and provide
support through bursaries and grants.</p>
<p>We believe in building a <strong>green</strong> future together. Our neighbourhoods
come alive with corridor plantings and community gardens. Many residents
have become passionate Green Ambassadors, taking on projects to raise environmental
awareness and making our homes greener.</p>
