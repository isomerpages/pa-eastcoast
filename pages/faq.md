<h4>WHAT IS THE EAST COAST PLAN?</h4>
<p>Under the East Coast Plan, we create a <strong>vibrant, caring,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>green</strong>&nbsp;community
where residents feel that they belong. More importantly, they are empowered
to make a difference for their fellow Easties.</p>
<p>Easties come from diverse backgrounds with varying interests and needs.
We&nbsp;<strong>care</strong>&nbsp;for each and every one of our residents.
The&nbsp;East Coast has the highest number of active seniors aged 50 years
and above in Singapore, and we want our seniors to feel safe and cared
for. We also support underprivileged households and individuals with social
assistance schemes to help them deal with day-to-day challenges.</p>
<p>Easties are proud of our <strong>vibrant</strong> community. Our food, heritage,
recreational, and sporting facilities attract many to the East. Community
centres, neighbourhood exercise corners, park connectors, and new sports
halls encourage our residents of all ages to pursue a healthy and active
lifestyle. We continue to bring greater vibrancy to our community, uplifting
and nurturing our young through lifelong learning programmes and providing
support through bursaries and grants.</p>
<p>We believe in building a <strong>green</strong> future together. Our neighbourhoods
come alive with corridor plantings and community gardens. Many residents
have become passionate Green Ambassadors, taking on projects to raise environmental
awareness and making our homes greener.</p>
