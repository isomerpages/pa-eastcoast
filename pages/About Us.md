<h2><strong>CARING, VIBRANT &amp; GREEN</strong></h2>
<p>We are made up 5 unique divisions with one common goal; to make the <strong>EAST SIDE</strong> the <strong>BEST SIDE</strong>.</p>
<p>We care for one another, looking out for those among us who may need a
helping hand. It's this Kampung Spirit that bonds us.</p>
<p>We are a vibrant community, brimming with a rich diversity of food, culture
and people. We uplift each other and nurture our young, creating opportunities
for lifelong learning and acquiring new skills. We help our residents especially
the elderly and vulnerable groups embrace the digital age with confidence.</p>
<p>We want to build a green and sustainable East Coast. Our residents proudly
champion many green initiatives, cultivating community gardens and growing
their own edibles. Recycling and upcycling initiatives help us live a more
sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<p>We ask you to join us in our journey in building the most exciting place
in Singapore.</p>
