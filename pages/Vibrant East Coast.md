<h2>This is the most happening heartland in Singapore!</h2>
<p>We do not even know where to start telling you about all the exciting
upgrades that were done and will be done.</p>
<p>Take a drive around East Coast (which is going to take you awhile because
there are so many projects going on), you will see vibrancy in the everyday
things. From the 4 void deck murals in Changi Simei to the block murals
in our HDB blocks in Fengshan, we make the simple things come alive.</p>
<p>Did you know we also have refurbished MRT train seats used under our void
decks? It is quite a sight to see these colourful seats double up as seating
space for our residents.</p>
<p>We also have many projects undergoing transformation for all our residents.
The Old Kampong Chai Chee is awaiting a facelift to become a hub for our
youths, the LTA Via Duct is undergoing a transformation for more community
activities to held there, and who can forget the upcoming Bayshore developments
that all our young couples are looking forward to? Move a little further
down and you will meet East Coast Park, the iconic, long stretch that many
of us have countless memories cycling, having BBQ gathering, going to chalets,
fishing and other activities we grew up doing!</p>
<p>Not to forget, East Coast has the best supper spots in Singapore - thatâ€™s
why East Side, Best Side.</p>
