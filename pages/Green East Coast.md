<h3>Part of the East Coast Plan is to make Singapore greener. Why? Because we want to leave the earth in a good place for our future generations.</h3>
<p>Planting trees ar massive in our Green Plan, these are nature’s air-conditioning
systems. So as part of the OneMillionTrees movement, East Coast has organized
more xx events and planted more than xx trees to date.</p>
<p>We are also often found at our iconic Paddle for a Purpose, a series of
beach clean-up programmes that brings residents from all ages together
to clean up our beautiful beaches.</p>
<p>Our annual iconic event, GreenFest, also brings in likeminded partners
annually to kickstart initiatives, bring ideas together and take them to
fruition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also raised a total of XXX Green Ambassadors, all trained and
equipped to make a difference in their world. Here in East Coast, we are
proud to be Singapore’ green coast.</p>
