<h3>Part of the East Coast Plan is to make Singapore greener. Why? Because we want to leave the earth in a good place for our future generations.</h3>
<p>Planting trees is a massive part of our Green Plan, these are nature’s
air-conditioning systems. So as part of the OneMillionTrees movement, East
Coast has organized more <strong><u>xx events and planted more than xx trees to date</u></strong>.</p>
<p>We are also often found at our iconic <strong><u>Paddle for a Purpose</u></strong>,
a series of beach clean-up programmes that brings residents from all ages
together to clean up our beautiful beaches.</p>
<p>Our annual iconic event, <strong><u>GreenFest</u></strong>, also brings
in likeminded partners annually to kickstart initiatives, bring ideas together
and take them to fruition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also raised a total of XXX <strong>Green Ambassadors</strong>,
all trained and equipped to make a difference in their world. Here in East
Coast, we are proud to be Singapore’ green coast.</p>
<p>Some other initiatives include our <strong><u>Community in Bloom</u></strong> Projects, <strong><u>Grows for Good</u></strong> (Residents
grow their food and give back to the community), and our <strong><u>East Coast Recycles</u></strong>,
where we take used items to recycle them for a better purpose.</p>
