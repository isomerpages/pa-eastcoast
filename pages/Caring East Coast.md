<h2>East Coast has a wide range of programs and activities that continue to champion our caring pillar.</h2>
<p>From <strong><u>Mobile TCM</u></strong> that brings Traditional Chinese
Medicine to the doorstep of our residents to our <strong><u>WinSTEM</u></strong> that
empowers our women to do more in their industries, East Coast continues
to find ways to reach out to every walk of life.</p>
<p><strong><u>Community Fridges</u></strong> are easily spotted all over,
fostering a spirit of giving and caring among our communities. You will
also see opportunities that help our lower-income families, like <strong><u>Tech Saturdays</u></strong> with
laptop distributions and <strong><u>Hearty Meals</u></strong> that bring
warm smiles and warm foods to our people.</p>
<p>We also have Community Drivers who are readily activated if a neighbour
requires help reaching a medical facility.</p>
<p>These initiatives also continue to engage volunteers, where they give
back to the community. Many have shared they receive in their hearts more
than they have given. Indeed, Calvin Coolidge was right, <em>we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give</em>.
