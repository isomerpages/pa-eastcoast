<h2>East Coast has a wide range of programs and activities that continue to champion our caring pillar.</h2>
<p>From Mobile TCM that brings Traditional Chinese Medicine to the doorstep
of our residents to our WinSTEM that empowers our women to do more in their
industries, East Coast continues to find ways to reach out to every walk
of life.</p>
<p>Community Fridges are easily spotted all over, fostering a spirit of giving
and caring among our communities. You will also see opportunities that
help our lower-income families, like Tech Saturdays with laptop distributions
and Hearty Meals.</p>
<p>These initiatives also continue to engage volunteers, where they give
back to the community. Many have shared they receive in their hearts more
than they have given. Indeed, Calvin Coolidge was right, <strong>we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.</strong>
