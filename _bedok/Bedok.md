<p><em>Opinion is divided on how the name ‘Bedok’ came about, but some believe that it derives from the Malay word bedoh, a type of wooden drum used to issue the Islamic call to prayer in pre-modern times. Another theory is that the name comes from the Malay word ‘biduk’, a type of wooden fishing boat common to the area.</em>
