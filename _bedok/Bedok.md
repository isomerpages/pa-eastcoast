<p>One of the oldest neighbourhoods in Singapore, Bedok carries a rich heritage
and many of our residents have been living here for more than 30 years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The transformation of Bedok is remarkable, from amenities upgrades to
better accessibility, Bedok has improved over the years over multiple facelifts,
while retaining its original old school flavour.</p>

<p><strong><u>DID YOU KNOW?</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Opinion is divided on how the name ‘Bedok’ came about, but some believe that it derives from the Malay word bedoh, a type of wooden drum used to issue the Islamic call to prayer in pre-modern times. Another theory is that the name comes from the Malay word ‘biduk’, a type of wooden fishing boat common to the area.</em>
