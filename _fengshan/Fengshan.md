<p>Welcome to Fengshan!</p>
<p>Known for its rich culinary heritage, Fengshan is home to Shi Wei Da 食为大
at Bedok 85 Fengshan Market &amp; Food Centre. Did you know that the renowned
satay bee hoon earned the establishment a well-deserved spot on the Michelin
Bib Gourmand list in 2018 thus solidifying its status as a must-visit culinary
destination? Talk about excellence!</p>
<p>In addition to its culinary delights, Fengshan is home to historical landmarks
such as the Singapore Post Simpang Bedok, which was built between 1961
and 1963. This iconic post office received the prestigious award for 'Best
Maintained Post Office in Singapore' in 1964, reflecting its significance
in the community and its commitment to excellence.</p>
<p>As you explore our neighborhood, don't miss the captivating mural next
to Palmwoods Condominium's main gate. Painstakingly recreated by the Fengshan
Youth Committee over a week, this mural depicts rustic kampong life, offering
a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of Fengshan.</p>
