<p>Known to be a quaint neighbourhood, Changi Simei has a unique facade of
HDB flats and a very homely private residential area. The kampong spirit
is very alive in Changi Simei, and you will often see smiles and happy
faces in many of our community events.</p>

<p>This space has also encountered multiple facelifts, with a new Eastpoint
Mall, and many more cycling paths that link up all the estates.</p>
