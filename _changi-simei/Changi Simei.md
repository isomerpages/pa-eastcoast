<p>Known to be a quaint neighbourhood, Changi Simei has a unique facade of
HDB flats and a very homely private residential area. The kampung spirit
is very alive in Changi Simei, and you will often see smiles and happy
faces in many of our community events.</p>
<p>This space has also undergone multiple facelifts, with a new Eastpoint
Mall, and many more cycling paths that link the whole estate.</p>
<p>We have little gems hidden in our neighbourhood, like an old school hotel
from the 1950s tucked in our estate and one of the most beautiful art community
gardens in Singapore. The quiet sense of beauty in Simei never grows old.</p>
