<p>Changi Simei is renowned for its quaint charm, featuring a distinctive
blend of HDB flats and a welcoming private residential enclave. The kampung
spirit is very alive in Changi Simei, and you will often see smiles and
happy faces in our community.</p>
<p>This space has also undergone multiple facelifts, with a new Eastpoint
Mall, and many more cycling paths that link the whole estate.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood, there are hidden gems such as a historic hotel from
the 1950s tucked in the estate and picturesque community gardens in Singapore.
The quiet sense of beauty in Changi Simei never grows old.</p>
